00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:08.501
My name is Jason Weber, and my job is to make Internet Explorer fast.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.305
We care about Windows users, and Windows users spend over half their time inside the web browser.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.199
We want those users to have a great experience 


00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:18.390
and that means performance.


00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.593
Regularly on any given day we will measure the performance of IE hundreds of times


00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:25.504
typically using thousands of different tests


00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:31.291
which results in anywhere from five to six million plus different metrics that we end up analysing.


00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.567
We think about it in three different ways


00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:38.576
the first is we wanna make the web sites that customers use today extremely fast


00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.511
so your traditional browsing scenarios


00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:45.334
the second class is that we want to make the interactive AJAX applications 


00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.958
that the customers use every day extremely responsive


00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:52.892
and the third class is really the HTML5 applications of tomorrow


00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:55.391
and enabling the next generation of the web.


00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.207
In order to measure the performance of the browser


00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.048
we sorta had to build our own version of the internet

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:05.000
Both replicating different network topologies, different server configurations,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.000
as well as different client configurations and measuring anything from memory usage to CPU utilization, elapsed time,

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:18.100
that end users see and really try to get a representative sample

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.770
of what customers will see in their real world experience replicated in this lab.


00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.468
Benchmarks can be a very good way to measure performance.


00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.201
However, if they are are representative of what actual users are doing


00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.663
so if you have a small isolated benchmark it can be great for a subsystem


00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.523
but it is not so great to represent what the real world users are doing.


00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:40.023
Performance is a multidimensional problem

00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:44.023
and Javascript is only one of the eleven subsystems in the browser


00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:45.780
that impact performance


00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:50.384
With Internet Explorer 9 though we completely rearchitected our Javascript engine


00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:55.661
so that applications that make heavy use of Javascript are extremely fast.


00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.269
So we're optimizing for a wide range of machines. From things like the netbook over here


00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:05.077
to high end desktops with eight cores, lots of memory


00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:09.131
and we really wanna have that be a great experience across that range.


00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:14.829
Today's web browsers really haven't taken advantage of the full modern PC hardware


00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:18.918
and you're really limited to what developers can do inside their web applications.


00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:23.783
With Internet Explorer 9 we're unlocking the full power of the PC


00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:29.647
and enabling web developers the potential that native application developers have had for the past two decades.


00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:34.861
Our approach for graphics in IE9 has been to accelerate everything.


00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:40.005
Text rendering, graphics rendering, colors on background images, I mean


00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:43.786
really everything in IE9 that you see on the screen


00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:46.123
is powered and displayed through the GPU


00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:51.978
As we move into the future with vector graphics technology, whether it's canvas or SVG


00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.680
In IE9 those are also all hardware accelerated


00:02:55.772 --> 00:03:00.635
and as people employ those you should see much better performance than you would have


00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:03.101
had we not used the GPU.


00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:08.784
With Internet Explorer 9, the web pages that you browse to every day just got a whole lot faster


00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:11.214
and the HTML5 applications of tomorrow


00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:17.028
are now possible.

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:19.164
I think long term what GPU accelerated graphics

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.322
and coupled with the other performance improvements

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.018
it changes what you can do


00:03:25.174 --> 00:03:28.341
Things don't change overnight in the world anymore


00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.104
Not even on the web


00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:35.957
But you look two years out and I think people will wonder what a browser was like without GPU acceleration.
